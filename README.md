## Bootcamp Challenge 5
# Description

The repository for challenge 5 of my Web Development bootcamp. Here you will find the files required for submission. For this challenge we were tasked with creating a workday planner that allows the user to save tasks into local storage. The application displays the current date and time and will color code tasks as past, present or future events depending on the time of day.

# Deployed Application
Here is a link to the deployed application.

https://sergluna.github.io/bootcamp-challenge-5/

# Usage

To view my submission please review the index.html file and the deployed application link listed above. When the user visits the page they will be presented with a work scheduler. On the webpage there will be time slots where the user can write their hourly tasks and save them. The user can then save these tasks by pressing the save button to the right of the task box.

User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

A user clicks on slots on the color-coded calendar and edits the events.
